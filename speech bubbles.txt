Room 1:
Speech Bubble 1:
Huh? What’s this? Where am I? 
And what’s up with this room? 
Why does it seem so dark in here? 
Oh I see a light here…and a diary. 
Let’s see what is says:

Speech Bubble 2:
Huh, alright… let’s search for the lights.

Speech Bubble 3:
Damn, almost screwed that up… 
talk about making things unnecessarily complicated.
Still, that didn’t awaken any memories… 
Maybe if I search the room I’ll remember something.


Room 2:
Speech Bubble 4:
Ok, let’s see what we have here…

Speech Bubble 5:
Huh, there’s something here.. It’s locked, of course.
The code? Hmmm, maybe I’ve written it down:

Speech Bubble 5 :
Is that…is that a military uniform? 
I’m getting a headache .. “U.S. AIR FORCE… SMITH” 
What on Earth is this? Oh and an access card. 
Ok, something I can use, finally.

My uniform is here? Why did I leave it here? 
I should be getting back to the base - 
Wait? Where? I think my memories are coming back, 
but they’re all over the place. It makes no sense… 

I feel like someone is waiting for me. 
Maybe I had a close colleague of sorts. 
But, unfortunately, I have no courage to see him.


Room 3:
Speech Bubble 6:
Another weird messed up room… 
I need to leave this place as soon as possible.

Speech Bubble 7:
Alright, a PC, finally something useful. 
Maybe I’ll find some information here…aaaand it needs 
a password. Of course. Maybe I’ve wrote it down somewhere:

Speech Bubble 8:
Oh perfect another door… Well I have nothing to lose now. 
I feel like I’ve lost everything already…



Room 4:
Speech Bubble 9:
Is this..it?

Speech Bubble 10:
Wait..which one is the exist, what’s written here:
“ALL PAY FOR THEIR SINS. THERE IS NO EXCEPTION.
CHOOSE WRONG AND YOU DIE”
What on Earth is this?? What.. Aidan what is this? 
What should I do? Maybe there’s something in that damn diary:

Speech Bubble 11:
Alright, let’s see…

Speech Bubble 12.1 (DOOR 1):
All pay for their sins, pilot Smith. 
You chose wrong. 
Your fate is to remember all the pain you have caused, 
never to see your brother again.

Speech Bubble 12.2 (DOOR 2):
Aidan: Nadia…finally you’re here. I’ve been waiting for you, 
little miss pilot.  
Nadia: You are…no. Are you really here with me?
Aidan: Com’ere sis. Let’s go.
